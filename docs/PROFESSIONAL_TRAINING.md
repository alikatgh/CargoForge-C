## 📚 **Training Curriculum**

### **Module 1: Basic Ship Stability** (Beginner - 30 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **GM (Metacentric Height)** - The MOST important stability metric
  * Formula: GM = KB + BM - KG
  * Professional limits: 0.5m - 2.5m for cargo ships
  * Why it matters: Positive GM = stable, Negative GM = CAPSIZE!

- **List and Trim Control**
  * List (transverse tilt): Max 0.5° for normal operations
  * Trim (longitudinal tilt): Max 0.5° for normal operations
  * How to balance cargo port/starboard and fore/aft

**Certification:** Ship Stability Fundamentals

---

### **Module 2: Container Types & ISO Standards** (Beginner - 45 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **ISO 668 Container Types:**
  * 20DC - 20ft Dry Cargo (1 TEU)
  * 40DC - 40ft Dry Cargo (2 TEU)
  * 40HC - 40ft High Cube (2 TEU, taller)
  * 20RF/40RF - Reefers (refrigerated, NEED POWER!)
  * 20OT/40OT - Open Top (for tall cargo)
  * 20FR/40FR - Flat Rack (for oversized cargo)
  * 20TK - Tank containers (liquids)

- **TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit)**
  * 20ft = 1 TEU
  * 40ft = 2 TEU
  * Ship capacity measured in TEU (e.g., 5,000 TEU ship)

- **SOLAS VGM (Verified Gross Mass)**
  * Legal requirement since 2016
  * ALL containers must have verified weight
  * Maximum stack weight: 192 tonnes (SOLAS limit)

**Real-World Rule:**
**Heavy containers MUST be at the bottom of the stack!**

**Certification:** Container Identification

---

### **Module 3: IMDG Code - Dangerous Goods** (Intermediate - 60 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods)**
  * Class 1: Explosives (MOST dangerous)
  * Class 2: Gases (compressed, flammable, toxic)
  * Class 3: Flammable Liquids (gasoline, paint)
  * Class 4: Flammable Solids (matches, metal powders)
  * Class 5: Oxidizing Substances (can cause fires)
  * Class 6: Toxic Substances (poisonous)
  * Class 7: Radioactive Material (special handling)
  * Class 8: Corrosive Substances (acids)
  * Class 9: Miscellaneous (lithium batteries, etc.)

- **Segregation Requirements (CRITICAL!):**
  * **"Away from"** = Minimum 3 meters
  * **"Separated from"** = Minimum 6 meters
  * **"Separated by"** = Minimum 12 meters OR complete compartment

**Real-World Example:**
Explosives (Class 1) and Flammable Liquids (Class 3) MUST be separated by at least 12 meters!

**Certification:** Dangerous Goods Handling

---

### **Module 4: Professional Bay Planning** (Intermediate - 90 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **Bay/Row/Tier Slot System (BBRRTT notation):**
  * BB = Bay number (01, 02, 03...)
    - ODD bays (01, 03, 05...) = 20ft positions
    - EVEN bays (02, 04, 06...) = 40ft positions
  * RR = Row number
    - 01 = Port side
    - 00 = Centerline
    - 02 = Starboard side
  * TT = Tier number
    - 02, 04, 06... = Below deck
    - 82, 84, 86... = Above deck

**Example:** Slot "020482"
- Bay 02 (40ft position)
- Row 04 (starboard side)
- Tier 82 (1st tier above deck)

- **Loading Sequence (Professional Method):**
  1. **Bottom-up** (load lower tiers first)
  2. **Center-out** (balance as you go)
  3. **Heavy-first** (for stability)
  4. **Discharge port consideration** (accessibility!)

**Certification:** Cargo Planner (Bay)

---

### **Module 5: Ballast Tank Operations** (Advanced - 60 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **Ballast Tank Locations:**
  * **Fore Peak** - Front of ship (controls trim)
  * **Aft Peak** - Rear of ship (controls trim)
  * **Port Wing Tanks** - Left side (controls list)
  * **Starboard Wing Tanks** - Right side (controls list)
  * **Double Bottom** - Under holds (increases GM)

- **How to Correct Stability:**
  * **Ship listing to PORT** → Fill STARBOARD wing tanks
  * **Ship listing to STARBOARD** → Fill PORT wing tanks
  * **Bow down** → Fill AFT PEAK tank
  * **Stern down** → Fill FORE PEAK tank
  * **Low GM** → Fill DOUBLE BOTTOM tanks

**Professional Practice:**
- Calculate ballast BEFORE pumping
- Never fill/empty too fast (free surface effect!)
- Keep tanks "pressed up" (full) or empty

**Certification:** Ballast Operations

---

### **Module 6: Real-World Scenarios** (Advanced - 120 min)
**What You Learn:**
- **Multi-Port Loading Strategy:**
  * Ship visits Port A → Port B → Port C
  * Problem: How to load so discharge is efficient?
  * Solution: Plan BACKWARDS (last port first)
  * Keep discharge containers accessible

- **Overstowage (The Problem):**
  * When you must move containers to access others
  * Costs time = Costs money!
  * Professional planners minimize this

- **Real Challenges:**
  * Mixed cargo (dry, reefer, hazmat)
  * Weight distribution
  * Crane optimization
  * Port time minimization

**Certification:** Professional Cargo Planner
